## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties (variables)
- Flexbox for layout
- Mobile-first design approach
- Google Fonts (Outfit)

### What I learned

This project allowed me to focus on the small yet import aspects of front-end development, such as:
- Organizing and naming CSS custom properties
- Creating a responsive and centered layout with a minimal amount of code
- Using systemized spacing and consistent naming conventions

Here is a segment of the CSS variable structure I implemented:

```css
:root {
    --clr-bg: #dde7f2;
    --clr-card: #ffffff;
    --clr-title: #1f314f;
    --clr-text: #68778d;
    --clr-link: hsl(228, 45%, 44%);
    --ff-base: 'Outfit', sans-serif;
}
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I plan to:
- Focus on implementing the best accessibility practices
- Practice better implementations from Figma or design styles
